INTRODUCTION


Scheduling algorithms in operating systems establish the sequence in which processes are executed, taking into account parameters like arrival time and priority. These algorithms oversee the 
progression of processes from the waiting state to the ready queue, utilizing preemptive or non-preemptive strategies. Preemptive algorithms allow higher-priority processes access to the CPU, 
interrupting lower-priority processes already in execution. In contrast, non-preemptive scheduling does not interrupt processes once they begin execution, even if higher-priority processes are 
ready.

The traditional round-robin scheduling algorithm is preemptive, assigning each process a fixed time quantum for execution. When a process completes its time slice, it relocates to the end of the 
queue, and subsequent processes in the ready queue adhere to a First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) sequence.

The Selfish Round-Robin (SRR) algorithm, an improved version of the traditional approach, enhances its functionality. It prioritizes processes with prolonged or extended execution times and 
high priority, ensuring they obtain or receive the required Central Processing Unit(CPU) time. The selfish round-robin algorithm is designed to optimize the implementation beyond the standard 
round-robin method.

SRR aims to provide better service to ongoing processes compared to new ones. In SRR, processes in the ready list are divided into two groups, that is NEW and ACCEPTED. New processes wait, while 
accepted processes are served using Round Robin. The priority of a new process increases at a value of ‚ÄúA‚Äù and the priority of an accepted process increases at a value of ‚ÄúB‚Äù.  




IMPLEMENTATION



‚Ä¢	Processes in the ready list (when a process arrival time is up) will be grouped into two, that is, new and accepted queues.

‚Ä¢	If there are no processes in the accepted queue, then the new process or processes are moved or allocated directly to the accepted queue.

‚Ä¢	If there are processes already in the accepted queue, then the new process will wait in the new queue while the accepted processes are serviced (by round robin).

‚Ä¢	All new processes are allocated a priority value of ‚ÄúA‚Äù, while the priority of the accepted processes is increased by a value of ‚ÄúB‚Äù.

‚Ä¢	All accepted processes in this system have the same priority, and this priority increases over time at a certain value ‚ÄúB‚Äù. This ensures that every new process will eventually get accepted, 
preventing any process from being ignored for too long.

‚Ä¢	At the end of a time cycle, there is an increase in the priority value of the processes in the new and accepted queue by values of ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù respectively.

‚Ä¢	When the priority of a new process reaches the priority of an accepted process, that new process becomes accepted and it is moved to the bottom of the accepted queue.

‚Ä¢	Once a process at the top of the accepted queue runs, there is a decrease in service time (NUT) by 1.
‚Ä¢	If the process that has just run its service time (NUT) is not equal to zero, then it is moved back to the bottom of the accepted queue.

‚Ä¢	Once a process in the accepted queue runs out its service time (NUT) to zero, it is deemed as finished and then removed from the accepted queue.

The diagram depicts a simplified version of the script's flow. Each box represents a decision point or step, and arrows indicate control flow. The script executes the following steps primarily:
‚Ä¢	Initialization: To start, the script arguments will be parsed, initial values will be set, and arrays will be declared.
‚Ä¢	Parameter Error Checking: Verify the correctness of script parameters, such as the existence of the input file.
‚Ä¢	Main Algorithm: Iterate through the main algorithm loop until all processes are completed.
‚Ä¢	Process Executions and Queue Management: Manage processes of the accepted and new queues, update priorities and execute processes.
‚Ä¢	Output Results: Output the current status of processes at each time unit.
‚Ä¢	Check for Completed Processes: Verify if any processes have completed their execution.
‚Ä¢	Update Queues: remove completed processes from the accepted queue and update the new queue.
‚Ä¢	Increment Time and Output Results: Increase the time unit and output the updated results.
‚Ä¢	Continue Loop? Check if all processes are completed. If yes, proceed to the final steps and if no, continue to loop.
‚Ä¢	Print final Footer and Exit: Output the final status of processes, print the footer and exit the script.

Parameter Handling: 
The script is designed to ensure that the user provides an adequate number of positional parameters (at least 3) by performing a parameter-handling process. During this process, the parameters 
are assigned to variable names that help to improve the code's readability and clarity. By doing so, it becomes easier for the user to understand the code and make necessary modifications if 
needed.

Data Structure: 

The organization and storage of data is known as data structure.
The selfish round-robin algorithm is a technique used in Bash programming. It relies heavily on an important data structure called an Array. Arrays are like containers that can hold different 
pieces of information, and they are really useful because they are easy to access and use. Bash programming doesn't support more advanced data structures like Classes or multidimensional arrays, 
so Arrays are a great option. 
In this algorithm, different types of information are stored in separate containers (Arrays), and these containers are connected based on their position in the sequence. This helps the algorithm 
work more efficiently and get the job done faster.

# 2.Using multipe arrays(no multidimensional arrays in Bash)
declare -a nameOfProcesses=()
declare -a serviceTimeProcesses=()
declare -a arrivalTimeProcesses=()

declare -a nameOfNewQ=()
declare -a serviceTimeNewQ=()
declare -a priorityNewQ=()
declare -a statusNewQ=()

declare -a nameOfAcceptedQ=()
declare -a serviceTimeAcceptedQ=()
declare -a priorityAcceptedQ=()
declare -a statusAcceptedQ=()



Modularization with Functions: 
To make the code more organized and easier to understand, we used Bash functions. These functions encapsulate and hide specific logic. This helps to break down the code into smaller, 
more manageable pieces and promote readability. 
# 3. FUNCTIONS

# a. Function: For spacing out text properly.
adjustNumSpaces() {
    local numberOfSpaces="$1"
    local time="$2"

    if [ "${#time}" -ge 2 ]; then
        numberOfSpaces=$((numberOfSpaces - ${#time} + 1))
    fi

    echo "$numberOfSpaces"
}

# b. Function: To verify if a process has consumed the amount quanta required on the CPU.
verifyQuanta() {
    if [ "${serviceTimeAcceptedQ[0]}" -gt 0 ]; then
        ((timeConsumed += 1))
    else
        timeConsumed=$quanta
    fi
}

# c. Function: Outputing result either to stdout, file or both.
outputResultDestination() {
    local directOutput="$1"
    local content="$2"
    local outputToFile="$3"
    local addParameter="$4"

    if [[ "$directOutput" == "file" || "$directOutput" == "both" ]]; then
        # Make sure the directory structure exist.
        mkdir -p "$(dirname "$outputToFile")"
        # Check if added parameter is specified
        if [ "$addParameter" == "addParameter" ]; then
            echo "$content" >> "$outputToFile"
        else
            echo "$content" > "$outputToFile"
        fi
    fi

    if [[ "$directOutput" == "stdout" || "$directOutput" == "both" ]]; then
        echo "$content"
    fi
}

# d. Function: For formatting the process's state.
createHeader() {
    local name="$1"
    local numberOfSpaces="$2"
    echo -n "$name"
    
    for ((i=0; i<numberOfSpaces; i++)); do
        echo -n " "
    done
}
# e. Function: For printing error and exiting script.
displayErrorMsgAndExit() {
    local errorMsg="$1"
    echo "Error:  $errorMsg"
    exit 1
}


Error Handling: 
The program makes sure that the user chooses valid options. If the user makes a mistake and enters an invalid choice, the program shows an error message and stops running. Sometimes,
the program shows a warning and gives the user another chance to choose a valid option. There is a specific function called "displayErrorMsgAndExit" that is responsible for showing the error 
message and stopping the program.

# e. Function: For printing error and exiting script.
displayErrorMsgAndExit() {
    local errorMsg="$1"
    echo "Error:  $errorMsg"
    exit 1
}

USER PROMPT
The user will be prompted to select an output option using a simple option. Once they have made a selection, the script will validate their choice to ensure it is a valid option.
# prompt the user where the output of the results(of the algorithm) should be displayed.
while true;
do
    echo -e "Which of the following options do you want the output of the results to be displayed?  [OPTIONS: STDOUT or FILE or BOTH]"
    read userFeedback

    # Convert userFeedback to lowercase (for case-insensitive comparison)
    directOutput=$(echo "$userFeedback" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

    if [[ "$directOutput" == "stdout" || "$directOutput" == "file" || "$directOutput" == "both" ]]; then
        # if a correct option is given, exit the loop.
        if [[ $directOutput == "file" || $directOutput == "both"  ]]
        then
            while true;
            do
                echo -e "Which filename do you want to store output of the results?"
                read userFeedback
                if [[ -n "$userFeedback" ]]; then
                    outputToFile="$userFeedback"
                    break
                else
                    echo "CAUTION‚ùóÔ∏è: Kindly enter a filename. Cannot leave this field 
                    blank."
                fi
            done
        fi 
        break 
    else
        echo "CAUTION‚ùóÔ∏è: $userFeedback is not a valid option. Please provide either 
        STDOUT or FILE or BOTH."
    fi
done



The program uses a technique called a while loop to make sure that the user enters a correct choice before it moves forward with the next step.


Process reading and Main Algorithm:
The main functionality of the script initiates by reading the processes specified in the data file and segregating them into distinct arrays, namely ‚ÄúnameOfProcesses, serviceTimeProcesse, and 
arrivalTimeProcesses‚Äù. This is achieved by parsing each line into three columns using a space separator.
# Retrieve process from the provided path
while read -r line || [[ -n $line ]]; 
do
  read -r name service arrival <<<"$line"

  # Appending the new process array to the existing process array
  nameOfProcesses+=("$name")
  serviceTimeProcesses+=("$service")
  arrivalTimeProcesses+=("$arrival")
done < "${progArguments[0]}"

Once all the processes have been loaded, a script uses a process called the "selfish round-robin algorithm" to manage them. The script keeps track of time and continuously checks if there are 
any processes to be performed. If a process has taken up all the time it needs to be completed, it is moved to the end of the line (accepted queue) and its progress (status and service time) is 
updated. If a process has not been completed in the specified time(quanta), the script keeps track of how much time is left and moves on to the next process.
The script also keeps track of when new processes are added to the system and assigns them to either the "accepted" queue or the "new" queue. The script also updates the priority of each process 
and prints the current status of each process.
When a process is completed, the script removes it from the "accepted" queue and updates the count of completed processes. If there are any processes in the "waiting" queue, the script checks 
their priority against the first process in the "accepted" queue. If a process in the "waiting" queue has a higher priority, it is moved to the "accepted" queue and its progress is updated.
Overall, the script is designed to efficiently manage a large number of processes in a fair and orderly manner.
The script will stop running when all the tasks are done, and it won't show any error messages.

CRITICAL EVALUATION OF SELFISH ROUND-ROBIN ALGORITHM.

ADVANTAGES OF SELFISH ROUND-ROBIN (SRR) ALGORITHM

‚Ä¢	Equality and Fairness: SRR scheduling is fair to all processes because it gives each process an equal share of CPU time. This makes it a fairer scheduling algorithm and sets it apart from 
other algorithms that may favour specific processes.

‚Ä¢	Minimal-Overhead: SRR scheduling is a straightforward algorithm with minimal implementation overhead. It is easy to grasp and put into action, making it well-suited for uncomplicated systems.

‚Ä¢	Effective Usage of CPU: SRR scheduling helps use the CPU efficiently by letting processes use only the time they require. This lowers the chance of processes getting stuck without a reason, 
which can boost the overall system‚Äôs performance.


DISADVANTAGES OF SELFISH ROUND-ROBIN (SRR) ALGORITHM

‚Ä¢	Not Suitable for Real-Time Systems: SRR scheduling does not work well for real-time systems with strict timing needs. In these systems, it is crucial to make sure important tasks get CPU 
time promptly, which SRR scheduling cannot guarantee.

‚Ä¢	Ineffective Management of Priority: SRR scheduling does not handle process priorities properly. It treats all processes the same, which might result in high-priority tasks not getting enough 
CPU time.

‚Ä¢	Selfishness: One big issue with SRR scheduling is that it lets processes be selfish and use all their given CPU time, even when they do not need it. This can cause some processes to hoard CPU
time, making the overall system performance go down.
